# Concierge Agent — Design Conversation Transcript

**Date:** August 4, 2026 · **Participants:** Mahesh × Claude
**Note on fidelity:** every user message is reproduced verbatim (lightly trimmed of typos only where meaning is unaffected). Claude's responses are faithfully condensed to their full technical substance — every decision, correction, and rationale is preserved; conversational padding and tool-call mechanics are omitted. Spec/file changes are marked as `[→ file updated]`. This conversation produced: `spec.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `.env.example`, and the `/goal` kickoff prompt.

## 1 — Dynamic sub agent registry: is there a library?

**Mahesh:** So we have a three tier system under the Orchestrator. Tools -1:N-> Skills -1:N-> Sub agent (specialist or dynamic worker). We already follow the skill index and get skill progressive disclosure. We want something similar for sub agents instead of predefining them — agents register with clear detail into an agent registry; the orchestrator refers to the registry and chooses. Sub agents start separately and register at startup. Is there a library in Python/LangChain/LangGraph or do we build one? (This is for the self-service agent.)

**Claude:** No first-class LangGraph primitive — supervisor patterns take static agent lists at build time. The pattern described is exactly A2A Agent Cards: agents expose AgentCards at `.well-known/agent.json`; `langgraph-a2a-client` discovers cards and exposes agents as LangGraph tools; AgentScope Runtime has a Nacos-based A2A registry; a2a-registry.dev does skill-based lookup. Option 2: build a thin FastAPI registry (~150 lines) reusing the AgentCard schema. Selection mirrors skill progressive disclosure: compact card summaries in the orchestrator prompt → pick → load full card → invoke.

## 2 — Full dynamic chain from admin UI

**Mahesh:** So with option 1 we'd have an admin UI to dynamically plug in MCP servers, take in tools, create/update dynamic skills, then define sub agents that convert to A2A and work seamlessly — in addition to startup-defined hardcoded tools/skills/sub agents in their registries?

**Claude:** Yes, composes cleanly. MCP supports runtime plug-in natively (`tools/list` + `listChanged`). Skills are your own construct — a dynamic skill is a registry record referencing tool IDs. Sub agents: external specialists register at startup; admin-defined workers instantiate from a template and self-register. Key rule: **single read path, two write paths** — seed static entries at startup (`source=static`, protected), runtime entries `source=dynamic`; the orchestrator only ever queries the registry. Three gaps you own: worker lifecycle, registration trust, cache invalidation.

## 3 — Same repo, same application

**Mahesh:** All sub agents will reside in the same repository and same application. The dynamic sub agents registry with custom skills each with custom tool lists and personas — we'll leave to user discretion.

**Claude:** That drops A2A for the internal path — HTTP between in-process agents is overhead without isolation benefit. Keep: the registry pattern (in-app, same store as the skill index), AgentCard-shaped manifests (future extraction = wrapper not rewrite), progressive disclosure. Change: dynamic workers = LangGraph subgraphs built from config by a **worker factory**; invocation = direct subgraph call. Validation at save time so the orchestrator never selects a broken worker.

## 4 — Confirming the full chain

**Mahesh:** So is your solution dynamic and manageable from admin UI right from plugging in an MCP server after startup, tools picked up, custom skill (with minor persona) created, multiple skills combined into a sub agent with persona and a workflow — static and dynamic both?

**Claude:** Yes — but no library gives the chain end-to-end; libraries cover MCP ingestion and graph construction, the registries/UI/factory are ours. Steps: runtime MCP connect → tool registry; skill = tool IDs + minor persona; sub agent = skills + persona + **workflow spec** (ordered steps/small DAG the factory compiles into a subgraph). Static path = same schema, `source=static`. Load-bearing component: the worker factory.

## 5 — Pivot to standalone POC "concierge agent"

**Mahesh:** Why not create this as a standalone generic POC? Call it concierge agent, no custom or proprietary libraries, assume auth is safe (POC), include all features discussed. Ask me all your questions; then create a spec.md and we'll do spec-driven development with Claude Code. Be creative in the UI layer — MCP registration, tools registry with badges showing which skill a tool is tagged to and vice versa on skills and sub agents registries — everything viewable/editable/updatable like a well-defined admin UI.

**Claude:** Posed 15 questions with proposed defaults across Stack (FastAPI+LangGraph+React/Vite/Tailwind, SQLite-vs-Postgres, Anthropic API, per-agent model override), Runtime (MCP transports, workflow sequential vs DAG, routing single-pick vs planner, persona merge order, HITL), Product surface (chat tab, trace view, CRUD semantics, seed data), Delivery (monorepo layout, test scope).

## 6–9 — Decisions via tappable question rounds

**Mahesh (across three A2UI rounds):** Both stdio + HTTP transports. **DAG with branching.** Swap SQLite for **Postgres**. **Planner + parallel dispatch.** Admin view with **chat tab and run trace**. **HITL in scope** (pause + approve in chat). Default seed set (fetch + filesystem MCP, 2 skills, 1 sub agent). **Full tests incl. UI.** Then: "Swap SQLite and use Postgres. Read all is fine."

**Claude:** All locked → wrote the first complete `spec.md`: overview/goal, stack, data model (three registries + runs), workflow DAG schema with natural-language conditions, registry API, MCP manager, worker factory, orchestrator (plan→dispatch→aggregate), admin UI (6 pages, badge cross-linking), seed data, testing, six milestones. Two flagged defaults: LLM-evaluated condition strings; form-based DAG builder with react-flow read-only preview. `[→ spec.md created]`

## 10 — Native tools (subgraph-as-tool)

**Mahesh:** Does our spec include native tools — e.g. a real subgraph converted into a tool and mapped to a skill? Will it work? We should be wary of everything.

**Claude:** Spec hinted but would have broken (factory resolved tools only via MCP). Added §5b: `tools.kind = mcp|native`; native tools = code-defined (`@native_tool` scan), including compiled subgraphs via `as_tool()`; same LangChain tool interface. Guardrails: **no HITL inside native subgraphs** (interrupts don't propagate cleanly from tool calls), **no wrapping registry sub agents** (cycle prevention), nested trace via `run_steps.parent_step_id` + token callbacks. No dynamic native tools from UI — that's accepting executable code at runtime. Seed native tool `summarize-and-structure` proves mixed mcp+native in one skill. `[→ spec.md updated]`

## 11 — Kind taxonomy, tracing, ids

**Mahesh:** Do we have native|custom distinctions for skills and sub agents too? Needed for tracing — LangGraph, Grafana, logs for ELK. Also tool id optional (auto-uuid string, editable later); skill id strictly mandatory (reject requests without it); sub agents also native or custom; the pool of skills vs tools should be available for creating custom sub agents.

**Claude:** Two axes clarified: `source` (static|dynamic = who wrote it) vs `kind` (how defined): tools `mcp|native`, skills/sub agents `native|custom`. Native sub agents = hand-written compiled graphs registered via decorator, bypass the factory, HITL allowed (top-level). New §10 Observability: structlog JSON→ELK, OTel→Grafana, Prometheus `/metrics`, every span/log labeled `{tier, kind, source, entity_id, run_id, ...}`. One pushback on ids: primary `id` stays immutable uuid; editable identifier is a separate unique `tool_key` — internal refs use `id`, so renaming never breaks bindings. Strict `skill_id` references → 422 without. `[→ spec.md updated]`

## 12 — Direct exposure + resolution ladder

**Mahesh:** At tool and skill level, a setting to expose directly to the main agent. If enabled the main agent uses them; else a sub agent is spun — native or custom or dynamic in that order.

**Claude:** Added `direct_exposure` on tools and skills + the **capability resolution ladder**: (1) direct (exposed tool = plain call; exposed skill = inline tool-loop with persona), (2) native sub agent via new `covers_skill_ids`, (3) custom sub agent via `sub_agent_skills`, (4) **ephemeral dynamic worker** (factory-built on the fly, unregistered, traced kind=`dynamic`). Deterministic, logged as `route` steps. Warnings: exposure bloats planner context (default false, cap warning); direct tools carry no skill persona. `[→ spec.md updated]`

## 13 — Command center

**Mahesh:** Is everything controllable and updatable from UI? If not, make it. Every control like a command center in this admin UI.

**Claude:** Audit found five gaps, closed: **Settings page** backed by live-read `app_settings` (models, orchestrator limits, fallback toggles, MCP health, log level, LangSmith/OTLP), run **cancel/retry/delete/purge**, global **HITL queue**, static records get `status`/`direct_exposure` toggles (definitions stay locked), seed-reload + reconnect-all. Deliberate exception: API keys never in DB/UI — env only. `[→ spec.md updated]`

## 14 — Production-level POC review

**Mahesh:** Think about every gap, every possibility, every feature, static vs dynamic, native vs custom, and the actual aim — is spec.md really ready for spec-driven development? Ask questions (A2UI). Bear with the POC auth exclusion.

**Claude:** ~85% verdict; 8 gaps. Fixed five: **reachable-join semantics** (branches not taken can't deadlock joins), **planner validate→repair-once→fail**, explicit **SSE event contract**, `tool_key` default `{server}.{tool}`, **§13 env vars + conventions** (prompts as versioned files) + **§14 acceptance demo script** as definition of done; plus config **snapshots** frozen at dispatch and cooperative **cancel**. Three questions asked.

**Mahesh:** **Full history per conversation.** **On-error edges in DAG.** **Multi-skill ephemeral workers allowed.**

**Claude:** Applied all: `conversations` entity (planner sees full thread), `on: success|error` edges (one per node; error text lands in state; no edge → run fails), multi-skill sequential ephemeral workers. `[→ spec.md updated]`

## 15 — Architecture confirmation

**Mahesh:** All within Python, LangChain, LangGraph — or light middleware too?

**Claude:** All Python, deliberately light — locked into §2: **no broker, no queue, no Redis, no Celery**; asyncio in one FastAPI process; Postgres is the only stateful infra. LangGraph owns execution; LangChain used thin (tool abstraction + model client). Footnotes: Node/uv in the image only for seed stdio MCP servers; single-process restart kills in-flight runs (paused HITL survives via checkpointer). `[→ spec.md updated]`

## 16 — Kickoff kit v1

**Mahesh:** Final review; GitHub UI repo steps; where to place spec.md/CLAUDE.md and other files; kickoff prompt.

**Claude:** Final read caught four self-inflicted defects (layout, native path, dispatch wording, seed list) — fixed. Wrote **CLAUDE.md** (source of truth = spec; milestone discipline; hard constraints; conventions; verification = executed proof). GitHub steps + per-milestone kickoff prompt + fresh-session-per-milestone tip. `[→ CLAUDE.md created]`

## 17–18 — Provider agnosticism → non-negotiable port

**Mahesh:** Ensure it's model and provider agnostic — later I'll want to run it behind an enterprise model gateway that offers Claude or Gemini etc. … For the agnostic interface we must create that layer and use it even for Claude/Gemini. Non-negotiable — we'll eventually add an enterprise-gateway provider with its own model choices.

**Claude:** First pass: `init_chat_model` + `provider:model` strings. Second pass (your escalation was right): a real **`ModelProvider` port** (`provider_id`, `is_configured`, `list_models`, `get_chat_model`) + decorator-registered **adapter registry**; anthropic/google_genai/openai as thin built-in adapters; reserved slot for the custom gateway adapter — implement four methods, register, zero consumer changes. Common currency = `BaseChatModel`. **Shared adapter contract test suite** makes future adapters safe to drop in. Key-gated provider availability; provider-neutral prompts; `usage_metadata` token accounting. `[→ spec.md §2.1 + CLAUDE.md updated]`

## 19 — "Is it a bus?"

**Mahesh:** Did we use our own lightweight middleware? Are the three registries part of a bus? How is the architecture?

**Claude:** No bus. Registries are **passive shared state** (control plane) — components pull at decision time; nothing publishes or subscribes. Data plane = direct in-process calls; only cross-process traffic is MCP sessions and SSE. Four thin self-built layers: registry service, MCP manager, provider port, worker factory. If workers ever split out, the dispatch step is the single seam where a real queue would replace `Send` — everything else unchanged.

## 20 — Skills as markdown documents

**Mahesh:** What about skills — where do they reside, how defined, MD format? Predefined template in UI, multi-step process, tool use optional per step, ability to tag tools, minor persona, default seeded tools. Same question for sub agents.

**Claude:** Skills become **documents**: frontmatter (name/description/persona/tools/exposure) + markdown `instructions` body (multi-step). Native = `.skill.md` files scanned at startup; custom = same shape authored in a UI template editor (`{tool:...}` mentions validated against bindings). **Soft vs hard workflow line**: steps inside a skill guide the LLM within one node (a step need not tie a tool); the machine-executed workflow is the sub agent DAG. Sub agents deliberately stay structured jsonb — prose can't be validated or compiled. Tool tagging = availability; instructions = usage. `[→ spec.md updated]`

## 21 — Enterprise planning walkthrough + failure modes

**Mahesh:** Scenario: plug a planning MCP server → tools (metadata, reports, flows) → skill "financial metadata analyst" (persona + metadata tools + step instructions with planning-domain keywords) → repeat for reports and flow analysts → sub agent "flow admin" (metadata + flow skills, DAG, persona). Default tools available to all sub agents; skills exposed to orchestrator. What happens on "why is our revenue down in FY2024"? What if sub agent description/persona is bad? What if skill description/persona is bad?

**Claude:** Correction first: no ambient default tools — tools reach workers only through skills. Noted flow-admin lacks the reports skill the question needs. Scenario 1 (all good): planner picks the two exposed skills at **rung 1** (inline loops, isolated tools); flow-admin correctly unused. Scenario 2: bad **description** breaks stage-1 selection (probabilistic misrouting; oversell = wrong dispatch; structural rung-3 matching ignores descriptions entirely); bad **persona** never affects selection, softly degrades execution. Scenario 3: bad skill description → skipped at rung 1 / empty plan; bad skill instructions → confidently wrong output flows downstream; error edges don't catch semantic wrongness. Posture: **structure is validated, semantics are observed** — route steps + snapshots tell you which prose to fix.

## 22 — Loops and determinism

**Mahesh:** Is the DAG a loop or one-shot? Or dependent on orchestrator input? … Which parts are deterministic vs non-deterministic?

**Claude:** Three levels: skill node = bounded ReAct loop (added `max_tool_iterations` setting `[→ spec.md]`); DAG = one-shot acyclic traversal (cycles banned by policy; HITL suspends, never restarts); planner/conversation iterate above. Topology fixed, traversal input-dependent. Determinism buckets: fully deterministic (registries, ladder, compilation, DAG mechanics, infra); partially (planner/router/tool loops — stochastic choice inside validated envelopes: schemas, enums, caps); non-deterministic (semantics, MCP results, parallel completion order, humans). Runs aren't reproducible but always **explainable**.

## 23 — Evals deferred; M3 constraint

**Mahesh:** We'll add evals later — spreadsheet upload in a predefined format at skill and sub agent level, results to local LangSmith or remote API key/URL. … Order-insensitive reducers bound to M3 for the POC; demo then integrate elsewhere.

**Claude:** Added §15 (deferred, design-must-not-block): spreadsheet columns, skill-evals ride the rung-4 factory path, snapshots make rows reproducible, eval runs tagged, HITL auto-approved in eval mode; LangSmith endpoint/toggle in settings, key env-only. Reducer constraint written into §6 (keyed dict merges). `[→ spec.md updated]`

## 24 — create_agent vs StateGraph

**Mahesh:** How are we creating the orchestrator — create_agent? What about sub agents?

**Claude:** **`create_agent` for every tool loop; hand-built `StateGraph` for everything structural.** Orchestrator = StateGraph (plan/resolve/dispatch aren't a tool loop); custom sub agents = StateGraph shell with `create_agent` leaf nodes (model via `get_model()`, bound tools, assembled prompt, iteration cap); ephemeral workers same; native sub agents author's choice. `create_agent` = current LangChain 1.x constructor (successor to `create_react_agent`); composes as nodes cleanly. `[→ spec.md updated]`

## 25 — Middleware architecture + dual modes

**Mahesh:** We're comparing lightweight middleware — todo middleware, summarization middleware, custom tools/skills/sub-agents registry middlewares. I don't mind the orchestrator being create_agent with finetuned instructions; weigh SubAgentMiddleware. Everything must always be in sync across layers.

**Claude:** All real in LangChain 1.x; middleware hooks re-read state **per model call** = tightest sync. Verdict: don't choose — **make it a mode, middleware as the sync layer in both**. §7.0: ToolsRegistry / SkillsRegistry / SubAgentsRegistry middlewares (the only capability path into any `create_agent`), SummarizationMiddleware everywhere (fixes the long-conversation gap), OOB limit middlewares. **Sync invariant**: registries single source of truth; only compiled graphs cache (keyed `updated_at`). §7.1 graph mode (default, explicit planner); §7.2 agentic mode (single create_agent + TodoList + registry middlewares + `spin_worker`; interrupt-in-tool with idempotent replay). Same traces → honest A/B. Acceptance step 11: flip modes mid-project + plug a tool mid-conversation. `[→ spec.md updated]`

## 26 — Settling + two defaults

**Mahesh:** So: everything-registry is a dynamically synced middleware and persisted in PG? Open question = orchestration create_agent-with-middleware vs existing? Is that it? … (answers) Tools bind to skills and must not see other tools. Drop default tools — users select in UI. Only the orchestrator gets all tools AND skills directly, as backup when descriptions are bad — handle it itself rather than spinning a sub agent, still using the same skill. … Are we building both modes, flipped at startup or runtime?

**Claude:** Precision: registry **is** the PG tables; middlewares are its live projection — state in PG, sync in middleware. Isolation became an invariant (tested; holds even in fallback). Your backup idea became the **self-service full-catalog fallback**: only when routing fails (no confident match / resolution empty) does a fallback loop get ALL active tools+skills, exposure flags ignored, traced rung=`fallback` — bad descriptions become a visible metric. Both modes built; `orchestrator_mode` is a **runtime setting read per run** — flip in Settings, next message runs the other orchestrator. `[→ spec.md updated]`

## 27–28 — Tracing + middleware policy

**Mahesh:** Do we emit all traces? Local or remote LangSmith? Evals will need this. … Can we turn off tracing/LangSmith for evals and still see stuff locally? Do we use TodoMiddleware instead of our own planner? Maximize out-of-box middleware, custom only when OOB can't be tweaked? Is middleware reused across orchestrator vs sub agents?

**Claude:** **Three sinks, one label set**: PG `run_steps` always-on; OTel optional; LangSmith optional — local or remote by `langsmith_endpoint`, tracer built **per run from settings** (no restarts), key env-only, `run_id` cross-references all sinks. LangSmith off → eval runs still fully in PG + logs; only publishing skips. TodoList IS the planner in agentic mode; graph mode keeps the structured planner (that's the A/B). Your precedence rule adopted as law: OOB first → compose hooks → custom only for registry projection. Reuse = same classes, per-context config via one `build_middleware_stack(context)` helper: skill loops get Summarization + limits + **scoped** ToolsRegistry only (isolation enforced structurally); agentic orchestrator gets all three + TodoList; graph shell gets none; stateless instances. `[→ spec.md + CLAUDE.md updated]`

## 29 — README + placement + kickoff

**Mahesh:** Where to place files and kick off Claude Code; give a goal prompt; write the README (Claude Code updates it per implementation).

**Claude:** Wrote **README.md** (architecture-at-a-glance, key decisions, stack, getting started, milestone status table Claude Code maintains). Placement: spec.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md at repo root; `.env` uncommitted. GitHub UI steps + M1 kickoff prompt + fresh-session-per-milestone. `[→ README.md created; CLAUDE.md updated]`

## 30–31 — /goal

**Mahesh:** Shouldn't we use /goal in the prompt? … No no, /goal is a known Claude Code command — why not start our prompt with it?

**Claude:** First take (custom-command pattern) was **wrong** — verified against docs: `/goal <condition>` is real — persistent goal the session works toward, evaluator, `/goal show/clear`, survives resume, non-interactive via `claude -p`. Renamed our command to `/milestone` (avoid shadowing) and proposed goal-sets-done + milestone-sets-how pairing.

## 32 — Single-prompt kickoff

**Mahesh:** I don't like this. Single prompt starting with /goal that kicks off the ENTIRE spec-driven development; include details not already in spec.

**Claude:** Dropped `milestone.md`. Changed CLAUDE.md to **checkpoint-and-continue** (summary per milestone, proceed without review; pause only on spec ambiguity). Delivered one `/goal` block: verifiable end-state criteria (all M1–M6 in order, pytest/ruff/mypy/eslint green, all 11 acceptance steps proven with executed output, README complete, hard constraints intact: three services, provider port only, middleware-only capabilities, isolation, keys env-only, both modes switchable) + operating rules that **point at** spec/CLAUDE.md rather than duplicating them. Notes: re-issue after `/clear`; goal persists through compaction. `[→ CLAUDE.md updated]`

## 33 — Full-conversation audit

**Mahesh:** So we have everything covered — backend, tech, middleware, and the brilliant frontend UI commanding everything? Are you sure? If not, update spec or prompt; read the entire conversation and judge.

**Claude:** Re-read the arc. Backend fully covered; UI was *almost* — six sync gaps where later architecture outgrew §8, all fixed: kind badge+filter in the consistent table pattern; agentic-mode chat renders the **live todo list**; **fallback banner** in chat linking to its route step; **mode badge** on Runs (needed for the A/B); native sub agents render as definition **cards** (no DAG builder); masked MCP env/header values + full-catalog toggle + exposure-cap warning banner in Settings. Prompt unchanged (defers to spec). Named deliberate exclusions: no UI prompt-file editing; no conversation rename/delete. `[→ spec.md updated]`

## 34–35 — .env.example

**Mahesh:** Can you also give me the .env.example? … Give it as a copy-paste snippet.

**Claude:** Delivered (providers: ANTHROPIC required, GOOGLE/OPENAI optional-gating; POSTGRES_* + DATABASE_URL; LANGSMITH_API_KEY key-only; OTEL bootstrap; WORKSPACE_DIR, ports, VITE_API_BASE_URL). Fixed a §13 inconsistency: dropped `LANGSMITH_TRACING` env (enablement is a runtime setting). Principle: env = secrets + bootstrap; everything tunable lives in the command center. `[→ .env.example created; spec.md §13 synced]`

## 36 — Model params (effort / thinking)

**Mahesh:** Why is there no option to choose different model or effort level or thinking mode?

**Claude:** Model **identity** existed; model **configuration** didn't — real gap. Added normalized **`ModelParams`** `{effort: none|low|medium|high, temperature, max_output_tokens}` through the provider port; each adapter maps effort to its knob (Anthropic thinking budget / OpenAI reasoning effort / Gemini thinking config); `ModelInfo` declares supported params (422 on unsupported); contract suite tests the mapping. Overridable at **skill → sub agent → settings defaults** (planner/aggregator get their own params); `effort` joins the trace labels; UI controls in skill editor, sub agent editor, Settings. `.env.example` unchanged — these are runtime settings. `[→ spec.md updated]`
