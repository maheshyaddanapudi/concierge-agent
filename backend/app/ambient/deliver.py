"""The delivery plane (spec §17.5 — milestone M23): every ambient output is
an outbox row; this module decides WHEN each row reaches the human.

Four tiers: 0 interrupt (budget-debited, quiet-hours-suppressed to
digest-lead), 1 notify (user-returned edge or bounded deferral), 2 digest
(the default — flushed at configured times, on return from long absence,
and led by demoted interrupts), 3 silent (ledger only, delivered at insert).
Feedback becomes a persisted blended reward (§17.7 substrate), and
persistently imprecise categories are demoted one tier through the
append-only policy ledger (§17.6) — the same ledger the M25 learner writes.
