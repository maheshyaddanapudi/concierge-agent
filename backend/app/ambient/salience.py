"""Delivery salience (spec §17.5 — milestone M42).

Tier and urgency are declared *a priori* by whoever emitted the delivery;
nothing re-judges an alert on the merits of what it actually says. This
pass closes that gap for the one case where it matters most: a delivery
that was supposed to reach a human in real time and **did not**.

Two stages, cheap first:

1. a deterministic prefilter — urgency floor, real-time tier, and the
   **recurrence count over the row's `skey` lineage** (a thing that keeps
   coming back is evidence in itself; the system already collapsed those
   repeats and never read them as a signal);
2. an LLM-as-judge over the FENCED body returning
   `{verdict, reason, confidence}`.

Three outcomes, each written to the row's `salience` for the §17.6 ledger:

- **escalate** — lead the next digest. Never a re-interrupt: salience may
  raise an item's place in a queue the delivery plane already chose, never
  re-open a delivery decision or break quiet hours.
- **retain** — hand the content to §16 with delivery provenance, so a fact
  survives even though the notification carrying it was never read.
- **drop** — recorded explicitly; silence stays an explicit, logged decision.

The judge is advisory and **fail-open** (the §4 overlap-guard precedent):
on any error the row keeps exactly the disposition it already had.
