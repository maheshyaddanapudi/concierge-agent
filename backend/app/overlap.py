"""Overlap guard (spec §4): LLM-as-judge duplicate detection at save time.

Before a skill or sub agent is created/updated, the UI calls a check endpoint
that compares the draft against existing registry records — skills against
skills + tools, sub agents against sub agents + skills. The judge runs through
the same provider port as everything else; if it is unavailable the check
fails open (never blocks a save on infrastructure trouble). Tools are exempt
by design: MCP ingest is dynamic and two servers may legitimately expose
similar tools.
