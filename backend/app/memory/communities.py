"""Memory communities (spec §18.6 — milestone M31).

The Zep-style upgrade deferred at M13: synchronous label propagation over
the entity co-occurrence graph (two entities are neighbors when they share
a memory), deterministic tie-breaks (most frequent neighbor label, ties to
the lexicographically smallest), community label = the min member entity
id. Communities are rebuilt by a consolidation-class job — never per
query — and a member-set signature keeps summaries stable: only a changed
community re-summarizes (extraction model; a summarize failure keeps the
previous summary rather than losing it). Singletons form no community;
an empty graph is a no-op.
