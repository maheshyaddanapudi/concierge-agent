# Runtime Flows

Sequence diagrams for the five core runtime flows of the Concierge Agent POC. Every participant, endpoint, SSE event name, node name, and status in these diagrams is taken directly from the code cited in each walkthrough.

All HTTP paths below are mounted under the `/api/v1` prefix (`backend/app/main.py`).

The full SSE vocabulary, emitted by `RunRecorder.emit` (`backend/app/orchestrator/recorder.py`) and the runner (`backend/app/orchestrator/runner.py`), and subscribed to by name in `frontend/src/api/client.ts` (`streamRun`):

`run_status`, `plan`, `route`, `dispatch_start`, `dispatch_end`, `activity`, `token`, `thinking`, `answer_ui`, `hitl_request`, `error`, `done` — plus a `ping` keepalive that `chat_stream` (`backend/app/api/chat.py`) emits after 120 s of queue silence.

## 1. Graph-mode run, end to end

A graph-mode run is a hand-built LangGraph `StateGraph` with nodes `plan → resolve → coordinate → dispatch → aggregate` (plus `fallback`), compiled in `build_orchestrator_graph` (`backend/app/orchestrator/graph_mode.py`).

    Runner->>Bus: emit run_status {status completed}
    Runner->>Bus: emit done {answer, tokens}
    Bus-->>UI: SSE events render cards, ticker, streamed answer
```

**Walkthrough.** `POST /chat` (`backend/app/api/chat.py`) calls `create_run` — which inserts a `Run` row with `status="running"` — and `start_run_task`, which spawns `_execute` as a plain asyncio task in the same FastAPI process (`backend/app/orchestrator/runner.py`; no broker, per spec §2). The response returns `run_id` immediately; the UI then opens `GET /chat/stream/{run_id}`, whose generator subscribes to the in-memory `EVENT_BUS` (`backend/app/orchestrator/context.py`) and yields history replay followed by live events.

`plan_node` resolves the planner model from settings (`planner_model` falling back to `default_model`) and calls `run_planner` (`backend/app/orchestrator/planner.py`): it assembles progressive-disclosure catalog summaries through `registry_summaries` (each catalog gated by `apply_retrieval`, see [resolution-ladder.md](resolution-ladder.md)), invokes the model with `with_structured_output(PlannerOutput)`, then `validate_plan` checks entry-id uniqueness, `depends_on` references, `max_plan_steps`, and that every referenced capability id resolves to an active registry record. On errors it retries exactly once with the error list appended to the prompt; a second failure raises `PlanFailure` → `RunFailed`, and the run finishes `failed` with the raw planner outputs stored on `run.plan`.

`resolve_node` runs the deterministic ladder (`resolve_capability`, `backend/app/orchestrator/ladder.py`) for every entry, logging each decision via `record_route` (a `route` run-step plus a `route` SSE event). If *every* entry fails resolution the run diverts to `fallback_node` (when `orchestrator_full_fallback_enabled`) — otherwise partial failures become error outputs for the aggregator. `coordinate_node` (a `defer=True` node) re-runs after each dispatch wave; `dispatch_ready` returns `Send("dispatch", ...)` packets for every entry whose `depends_on` outputs exist, capped at `max_parallel_dispatch` — this is the parallel wave mechanic. Each `dispatch_node` executes `execute_resolution`, which records a dispatch step (`emit_dispatch=True` → `dispatch_start`/`dispatch_end` events) and drives the compiled worker through `invoke_worker_with_hitl`.

`aggregate_node` streams the aggregator model: reasoning chunks surface as `thinking` events, answer chunks as `token` events. Back in `_execute`, `_maybe_answer_ui` calls `generate_answer_ui` (`backend/app/orchestrator/answer_ui.py`) — a structured-output pass that produces A2UI v0.9 messages plus optional chart specs, failure-safe by contract — then the runner persists `status="completed"` and emits `answer_ui`, `run_status {completed}`, and the terminal `done {answer, tokens}` event.

## 2. Agentic-mode run

Agentic mode replaces the hand-built graph with a single `create_agent` concierge loop (`build_agentic_agent`, `backend/app/orchestrator/agentic_mode.py`). Planning is emergent via `TodoListMiddleware`; capabilities are projected live by the three registry middlewares on **every model call**.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Runner
    participant Agent as ConciergeLoop
    participant MW as RegistryMWs
    participant Cache as RegistryCache
    participant Ladder
    participant Bus as EventBus

    Runner->>Agent: astream {messages} stream_mode updates
    Note over Agent: middleware stack — TodoListMiddleware, SummarizationMiddleware, ModelCallLimitMiddleware, ToolsRegistry exposed, SkillsRegistry exposed, SubAgentsRegistry

    loop every model call
        Agent->>MW: awrap_model_call on each registry middleware
        MW->>Cache: tools exposed_only / skills exposed_only / sub_agent_cards
        Note over MW: apply_retrieval ranks each catalog, catalog_footer announces truncation
        MW-->>Agent: request.override — live tools use_skill_* dispatch_* + skill catalog in system prompt
        Agent->>Agent: model call with spin_worker and use_full_catalog always bound
        Agent->>Bus: emit plan {todos, mode agentic} when TodoList state changes
    end

    alt model calls use_skill_<name>
        Agent->>Ladder: run_inline_skill — scoped skill loop
    else model calls dispatch_<name>
        Agent->>Ladder: resolve_capability {type sub_agent} then execute_resolution
    else model calls spin_worker
        Agent->>Ladder: resolve_capability {type spin_worker, skill_ids}
        Note over Ladder: rung dynamic_worker — ephemeral chain, callsign worker-alpha etc.
    else model calls use_full_catalog
        Agent->>Agent: ctx.flags.full_catalog = True
        Note over Agent: next model call re-projects with every active tool and skill
    end
    Ladder->>Bus: emit route / dispatch_start / activity / dispatch_end

    Agent-->>Runner: final AI message without tool_calls
    Runner->>Bus: emit token {text} — full answer
    Runner->>Bus: emit answer_ui, run_status completed, done
```

**Walkthrough.** `_run_agentic` (`backend/app/orchestrator/runner.py`) builds the agent with `build_middleware_stack(AgenticLoopContext(...))` (`backend/app/orchestrator/middleware.py`), which composes, in order: `TodoListMiddleware`, `SummarizationMiddleware`, `ModelCallLimitMiddleware` (limit `max(max_tool_iterations * 3, 12)`), then the three registry projections — `ToolsRegistryMiddleware(mode="exposed")`, `SkillsRegistryMiddleware(mode="exposed")`, `SubAgentsRegistryMiddleware()`.

The only statically bound tools are the two capability tools defined in `agentic_mode.py`: **`spin_worker`** (`skill_ids: list[str], task: str` — registry UUIDs only, bad ids return an error string so the loop self-corrects) and **`use_full_catalog`** (flips `ctx.flags.full_catalog`, recorded as a `route` step with rung `fallback`). Everything else is projected per model call in `awrap_model_call`: `ToolsRegistryMiddleware._resolve` materializes live tool objects from the cache (exposed-only, retrieval-gated); `SkillsRegistryMiddleware._refresh` builds a `use_skill_<sanitized-name>` tool per exposed skill and injects an "Available skills" catalog — with registry ids, since `spin_worker`'s contract is ids-only — into the system prompt; `SubAgentsRegistryMiddleware._refresh` builds a `dispatch_<sanitized-name>` tool per sub-agent card whose handler is the resolution-ladder executor. Because the projection re-runs every model call, a registry write made mid-run is visible on the very next iteration, and `use_full_catalog` widens the projection live.

The runner consumes `agent.astream(..., stream_mode="updates")`, extracting the `todos` state each update and emitting `plan {todos, mode: "agentic"}` whenever the list changes — that is the live todo checklist the chat renders. The final answer is the last AI message without tool calls (`final_answer_from_messages`); the runner records it as an `aggregate` step for label comparability and emits it as a single `token` event, then follows the same `answer_ui` → `run_status {completed}` → `done` tail as graph mode.

## 3. HITL pause and resume

HITL gates are `hitl` nodes in worker DAGs (`_make_hitl_node`, `backend/app/factory/worker.py`) that call LangGraph `interrupt()`. The pause propagates worker → dispatch handler → orchestrator thread, and resume rides the Postgres checkpointer.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Chat as ChatCard
    participant Queue as SettingsQueue
    participant API as ChatAPI
    participant Runner
    participant Worker
    participant Bus as EventBus

    Worker->>Worker: hitl node — interrupt {prompt, node_id, questions}
    Worker->>Bus: emit hitl_request {prompt, node_id, questions, step_id}
    Note over Worker: invoke_worker_with_hitl re-raises interrupt with worker_thread and dispatch_step_id
    Runner->>Runner: graph state has __interrupt__ — set run paused_hitl
    Runner->>Bus: emit run_status {status paused_hitl}
    Bus-->>Chat: HitlCard renders — approve/deny, form questions when present

    alt resolved from the chat card
        Chat->>API: POST /runs/{run_id}/hitl {decision, note, answers}
    else resolved from the Settings HITL queue
        Queue->>API: POST /runs/{run_id}/hitl {decision approve, note ""}
        Note over Queue: queue lists GET /hitl/pending — runs with status paused_hitl
    end
    API->>Runner: resume_run — requires status paused_hitl
    API-->>Chat: 200 {status resuming}

    opt second resolver races
        Chat->>API: POST /runs/{run_id}/hitl
        API-->>Chat: "409 — run is running, not paused_hitl"
        Note over Chat: HitlCard catch handler collapses the card anyway
    end

    Runner->>Runner: start_run_task with resume {decision, note, answers}
    Runner->>Bus: emit run_status {status running}
    Runner->>Worker: Command resume targeted at first live interrupt id
    Note over Worker: replay — find_running_dispatch adopts the open dispatch step, prior hitl interrupts burned, hitl_request not re-emitted
    Worker->>Worker: hitl node returns approved or denied node_output
    Note over Worker: deny routes the node to END via the router step
    Worker-->>Runner: run continues to aggregate / next gate
    Bus-->>Chat: run_status running — gateConsumed collapses armed card
```

**Walkthrough.** When a worker hits an `hitl` node, `interrupt(payload)` fires with `{prompt, node_id}` plus `questions` for form gates (validated at save time by `validate_workflow`, `backend/app/factory/dag.py`: kinds `approve|choice|text`, unique ids, choice needs ≥ 2 options). `invoke_worker_with_hitl` (`backend/app/orchestrator/ladder.py`) catches the worker's interrupt, emits the **`hitl_request`** SSE event — payload `{prompt, node_id, questions, step_id}` where `step_id` is the owning dispatch step so the chat can nest the card under its sub-agent rail — and re-raises `interrupt()` on the orchestrator thread, adding `worker_thread` and `dispatch_step_id` so the runner can tell live gates from stale ones when parallel dispatches interrupt at once. `_execute` sees `__interrupt__` in the returned state, sets the run to **`paused_hitl`**, and emits `run_status {paused_hitl}`.

Both resolution surfaces POST the **same endpoint**: the chat `HitlCard` (`frontend/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx`) sends `{decision, note, answers?}`, and the Settings HITL queue (`frontend/src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`, backed by `GET /hitl/pending` in `backend/app/api/settings.py`) sends `{decision, note: ""}`. `resolve_hitl` (`backend/app/api/chat.py`) calls `resume_run`, which raises `ValueError` unless `run.status == "paused_hitl"` — surfaced as **HTTP 409** ("run is running, not paused_hitl") to any second resolver. The card's catch handler treats 409 as "resolved elsewhere" and collapses rather than staying armed-but-dead.

Resume is a fresh `start_run_task(run_id, resume={...})`: the runner flips status back to `running`, and `_resume_command` inspects pending interrupts on the checkpoint thread — when several gates are pending it targets the first **live** one by interrupt id (`Command(resume={target.id: resume})`), so the run pauses again for the remaining gates instead of erroring. On the worker thread, replay is idempotent: `find_running_dispatch` adopts the existing dispatch step instead of recording a duplicate, previously answered `hitl` interrupts are "burned" so the pending one lines up with the delivered resume value, and the pre-pause `hitl_request` is not re-emitted. Approve continues (answers ride into worker state as `node_outputs[node_id].answers`); deny records `{status: "denied", note}` and the router step routes the node to `END`. If the resumed run pauses again, `_emit_pending_hitl` re-announces the still-waiting gates.

On the frontend, `LiveRun` computes `gateConsumed`: any `run_status` event **after** the newest `hitl_request` whose status is not `paused_hitl` marks the gate as consumed — whether via this card, the Settings queue, a cancel, or a resume replay — so armed buttons are never left on a gate the backend already closed. See [state-machines.md](state-machines.md) for the full gate lifecycle.

## 4. MCP server plug-in

The MCP connection manager (`McpManager`, `backend/app/mcp/manager.py`) owns one client session per active `mcp_server` record, each held open by its own asyncio task.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as McpServersPage
    participant API as McpAPI
    participant Mgr as McpManager
    participant Srv as McpServer
    participant DB as Postgres
    participant Cache as RegistryCache
    participant Agent as AgentLoop

    UI->>API: POST /mcp-servers {name, transport, command/url, ...}
    API->>DB: insert row — source dynamic, status inactive
    API->>Mgr: connect_server(server_id)
    alt transport stdio
        Mgr->>Srv: stdio_client — spawn command with proxy env passthrough
    else transport streamable HTTP
        Mgr->>Srv: streamablehttp_client(url, headers)
    end
    Mgr->>Srv: ClientSession.initialize
    Mgr->>Srv: list_tools
    Mgr->>DB: upsert Tool rows — kind mcp, tool_key "server.tool", source inherited
    Note over Mgr: removed tools flipped to status inactive
    Mgr->>Cache: invalidate("tools")
    Mgr->>DB: server status active, last_connected_at
    API-->>UI: 201 McpServerOut with tool_count

    Agent->>Cache: next model call — ToolsRegistryMiddleware._resolve
    Note over Cache: tools registry dirty — reload from Postgres
    Cache-->>Agent: new MCP tools bound as lazy proxies — callable immediately

    Srv--)Mgr: notifications/tools/list_changed
    Mgr->>Mgr: _handle_notification — ToolListChangedNotification
    Mgr->>Srv: _safe_refresh — list_tools again
    Mgr->>DB: reconcile upserts / inactive marks
    Mgr->>Cache: invalidate("tools")

    loop every mcp_health_interval_s
        Mgr->>Srv: send_ping timeout 5s
        alt ping fails
            Mgr->>Mgr: _teardown connection
            Mgr->>DB: server status error, last_error "health ping failed"
            UI->>API: POST /mcp-servers/{id}/reconnect
            API->>Mgr: connect_server — full connect + re-ingest
        end
    end
```

**Walkthrough.** `POST /mcp-servers` (`backend/app/api/mcp_servers.py`) inserts the row with `source="dynamic"` and `status="inactive"` — registered but not yet connected — then calls `manager.connect_server`. The manager tears down any prior connection, starts `_run_connection` (which holds `stdio_client` or `streamablehttp_client` plus a `ClientSession` open until a stop event), waits up to 25 s for `ready`, then runs `_ingest`: `list_tools()` results are upserted into the tools registry with `kind="mcp"`, `tool_key = f"{server.name}.{spec.name}"` (collision-suffixed with a hex fragment), source inherited from the server; tools no longer listed are flipped to `status="inactive"`. Ingest ends with `get_cache().invalidate("tools")` and the server row goes `active`; any failure lands the row on `error` with a described `last_error`.

Because run-path tool projection reads through the registry cache on **every model call** (`ToolsRegistryMiddleware._resolve`), the invalidation makes new tools callable in the very next agent-loop iteration with no restart. The bound tools are lazy proxies (`_make_mcp_proxy`, `backend/app/factory/worker.py`) that resolve the live session at call time — so a dead server surfaces as a tool error and a reconnected one works with no rebuild.

The **listChanged** path: the `ClientSession` message handler routes `ToolListChangedNotification` to `_safe_refresh`, which re-runs `_ingest` — same reconcile, same invalidation. **Health**: `_health_loop` re-reads `mcp_health_interval_s` from settings each cycle and calls `ping_all`; a `send_ping` that fails or exceeds 5 s tears the connection down and records `status="error"` / `last_error="health ping failed"`. The UI offers `POST /mcp-servers/{id}/reconnect` and `POST /mcp-servers/{id}/refresh-tools` (`frontend/src/pages/McpServersPage.tsx`). Deleting a server is refused with 409 while its tools are bound to skills; otherwise it soft-deletes the server and its tools, invalidates the cache, and disconnects. Server state values are diagrammed in [state-machines.md](state-machines.md).

---

## 5. Cache invalidation and cross-replica sync

Every registry and settings read in the run path goes through the singleton `RegistryCache` (`backend/app/registry_cache.py`). Freshness is **event-invalidated**: no TTLs — an entry is current or invalidated.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as RegistryUI
    participant API as WriteAPI
    participant DB as Postgres
    participant CA as CacheA
    participant CB as CacheB
    participant Agent as AgentLoop

    UI->>API: "PATCH /tools/{id} (or skills / sub-agents / mcp ingest / settings)"
    API->>DB: commit the write
    API->>CA: get_cache().invalidate("tools")
    CA->>CA: _mark_dirty — generation++, dirty set
    Note over CA: relationship propagation — tools dirty skills, skills dirty sub_agents
    CA->>DB: "pg_notify(registry_cache_inv, origin:tools)"
    DB--)CB: LISTEN registry_cache_inv fires
    CB->>CB: _on_notify — own origin filtered out
    CB->>CB: _mark_dirty only — no re-notify, loops impossible
    API-->>UI: 200 updated record

    Agent->>CA: next read — cache.tools / skills / sub_agents
    CA->>DB: _ensure — registry dirty, reload wholesale
    CA-->>Agent: fresh records, dirty flag cleared

    opt manual refresh button
        UI->>API: POST /cache/refresh/{registry} or /cache/refresh/all
        API->>CA: cache.refresh — invalidate + eager reload force
        CA-->>UI: {records, generation, loaded_at, cached}
    end
```

**Walkthrough.** Every registry write path — `backend/app/api/tools.py`, `skills.py`, `sub_agents.py`, `mcp_servers.py`, `seed.py`, and the MCP manager's `_ingest` — commits to Postgres first, then calls `get_cache().invalidate(registry)` before returning. `invalidate` does two things: `_mark_dirty` locally, and `_notify_peers` for other replicas.

`_mark_dirty` bumps the registry's generation counter and adds it to the dirty set, then walks the hard-coded dependents map `{"tools": ("skills",), "skills": ("sub_agents",)}` — skills embed tool rows and sub-agent records embed skill names, so dirtying a parent transitively dirties dependents without any write hook knowing the dependency graph. In `redis` mode it also deletes the corresponding Redis blob. A settings invalidation additionally re-reads `registry_cache_mode` so a mode flip via PATCH takes effect live.

`_notify_peers` broadcasts `pg_notify('registry_cache_inv', f"{origin}:{registry}")` where `origin` is a per-process UUID hex minted at cache construction. Each replica's `start_listener` holds a dedicated asyncpg connection with `add_listener` on the same channel; `_on_notify` drops payloads whose origin matches its own (the sender already marked itself dirty) and otherwise schedules `_mark_dirty` — deliberately *not* `invalidate` — so a notification can never trigger another notification: loops are impossible by construction. Notify is best-effort; single-replica correctness never depends on it.

Reload is lazy: the next read through `_ensure` sees the dirty flag (in `memory` mode) or the deleted blob (in `redis` mode) and reloads the registry wholesale from Postgres — registries are small, and a full reload can never leave a stale embedded relationship. In the default `bypass` mode every read is a direct Postgres query and invalidation only bumps generations.

The **manual refresh** path: the "⟳ Refresh cache" button (`frontend/src/components/CacheControls.tsx`, `useRefreshCache` in `frontend/src/api/hooks.ts`) posts `POST /cache/refresh/{registry}` — or `all` — handled in `backend/app/api/cache.py`, which calls `cache.refresh`: invalidate (including the peer notify) plus an **eager** `_ensure(force=True)` reload, returning `{records, generation, loaded_at, cached}` for the status line next to the button. `GET /cache/status` feeds the same UI.
