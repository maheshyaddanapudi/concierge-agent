# 07 — Experiment results: memory-layer ablation on the live stack

**Date:** 2026-08-20 · **Branch:** `memory_xperiment` · **Harness:** `experiments/memory/`

This is the measured comparison the branch was named for: the finished M13–M17
memory subsystem, run layer-by-layer against the existing solution (memory
dark), on the live stack, with real model calls and deterministic grading.

## 1. Method

- **Live stack, real runs.** Every probe turn is a real `POST /chat` against the
  running compose stack (graph orchestrator; default model
  `anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6`, planner role overridden to
  `anthropic:claude-sonnet-5` at high effort — a stage-20 setting that was
  identical across all five configs, and the planner's `direct_answer` is what
  answers these probes). Conversation slots map to real conversations,
  so cross-conversation recall is genuinely cross-conversation — nothing is
  simulated or short-circuited.
- **Probe suite** (`experiments/memory/probes.py`): 7 probes over the six
  LongMemEval ability categories (research 03 §6) — information extraction ×2,
  multi-session reasoning, knowledge update, temporal reasoning, abstention,
  preference following. Grading is fully deterministic (required/forbidden
  substrings, bullet counts) — no LLM judges, so reruns are comparable.
- **Configs** (`experiments/memory/harness.py`): each config purges memories +
  runs, resets settings, then runs the whole suite fresh:

  | config | layers | settings delta |
  |---|---|---|
  | `off` | none — the existing solution | `memory_enabled=false` |
  | `episodic` | L0/L1 digests + rollups | extraction off, procedural off |
  | `semantic` | + L2 extraction/reconciliation | extraction on |
  | `full` | + L3 procedural exemplars/stats | procedural on |
  | `tight` | full, starved | injection budget 1200→250 tokens, score floor 0.35→0.6 |

- **Embeddings:** the deterministic fake provider (`fake:scripted`, 64-dim
  bag-of-tokens) drives the vector leg of hybrid recall, because the stack's
  only configured key is Anthropic and Anthropic has no embeddings API. This
  is a **conservative floor**: real embedding models separate paraphrases far
  better than bag-of-tokens cosine, so vector-recall quality can only improve
  in production.
- **Metrics:** pass/fail per probe, input/output tokens on question runs
  (`usage_metadata` totals from the runs ledger), setup-turn tokens separately,
  wall-clock latency per question.

## 2. Headline matrix

| config | score | question input tok | question output tok | setup input tok | mean latency | active memories |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **off** (existing solution) | 2/7 | 109,479 | 8,966 | 31,620 | 24.9 s | 0 |
| **episodic** | 6/7 | 54,419 | 3,494 | 33,369 | 9.3 s | 0 |
| **semantic** | **7/7** | **39,851** | **2,187** | 33,607 | **7.1 s** | 7 |
| **full** | 7/7 | 56,664 | 3,135 | 49,318 | 9.0 s | 6 |
| **tight** | 7/7 | 76,863 | 6,986 | 33,603 | 17.7 s | 6 |

Per ability:

| ability | off | episodic | semantic | full | tight |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| information extraction | 0/2 | 1/2 | 2/2 | 2/2 | 2/2 |
| multi-session reasoning | 0/1 | 1/1 | 1/1 | 1/1 | 1/1 |
| knowledge update | 0/1 | 1/1 | 1/1 | 1/1 | 1/1 |
| temporal ("before the change") | 0/1 | 1/1 | 1/1 | 1/1 | 1/1 |
| abstention | 1/1 | 1/1 | 1/1 | 1/1 | 1/1 |
| preference following | 1/1 | 1/1 | 1/1 | 1/1 | 1/1 |

## 3. Findings

### F1 — Memory improves accuracy *and* cost at the same time

The baseline doesn't just fail 5/7 probes — it burns **2.7× the input tokens**
(109k vs 40k) and **3.5× the latency** (24.9s vs 7.1s) failing them. Without
memory, the orchestrator answers "what's my dog's name?" by searching the
workspace, listing files, and trying tools before giving up; with memory the
injected block answers it in one pass. Memory is not a tax on the run path —
on this workload it is a *discount*.

### F2 — Semantic (L1+L2) is the sweet spot

`semantic` is the only config on the Pareto frontier for all three axes:
perfect score, fewest tokens, lowest latency. Extraction distills setup turns
into compact facts ("dog is named Biscuit", `entity_key=deploy_branch →
release-2026`), which inject smaller and rank better than raw episodic
digests. It also passed the temporal probe: the reconciliation pipeline's
supersession chain kept the pre-correction value (`main`) answerable — the
ability LongMemEval calls the field's weakest.

### F3 — Episodic alone is strong but has a first-touch gap

`episodic` (digests only, no extraction) scored 6/7 at half the baseline's
cost. Its one failure was `single_fact_recall` — the *first* question of the
suite, asked immediately after the facts were stated in another conversation.
Digest-only recall lost the race/ranking on first touch, yet passed
`second_fact_recall` over the same digest minutes later. Semantic extraction
eliminates this gap (facts land as ranked, compact memories immediately).

### F4 — Procedural learning is cost-neutral-to-negative on knowledge probes — as designed

`full` kept the 7/7 score but spent ~42% more question tokens than `semantic`
(56.7k vs 39.9k) and ~47% more setup tokens (exemplar harvesting runs after
every setup turn). Plan exemplars target *routing* quality, and none of these
probes exercise routing — so on this suite L3 is overhead. Its measured goal
(fallback-rate reduction on indirect asks) is tested separately in §4.
Tweaking conclusion: **enable L3 only if your workload routes to
skills/sub-agents; leave it off for pure Q&A assistants.**

### F5 — Starving the injection budget doesn't break accuracy, it moves the cost

`tight` (budget 250 tokens, floor 0.6) still scored 7/7 — but at ~2× the
tokens and ~2.5× the latency of `semantic`. When injection is starved, the
model compensates through the `memory.recall` tool and extra exploration:
correctness survives (the tools are registry citizens precisely for this),
but every compensating recall is a full round trip. Tweaking conclusion:
**a generous injection budget is net cheaper than a starved one** — the
1200-token default beats 250 on every axis; cutting budget is a false economy.

### F6 — Abstention held at every layer (with one grader lesson)

No config transplanted the dog's name onto the cat — the data-fenced block
plus the abstention line ("If the memories don't cover it, say so") held even
with 7 active memories injected. An earlier grader draft forbade the substring
"biscuit" outright and flagged the correct answer "I only have information
about your dog, Biscuit" — the forbid rule now targets actual transplantation
("cat's name is biscuit"), which is the honest failure mode.

## 4. M16 measured goal — fallback rate with procedural learning

**Design** (`experiments/memory/fallback_experiment.py`): warm plan exemplars
with two successful direct-phrased asks that route to sub agents
(site-analyst → `custom_sub_agent`, workspace-warden → `native_sub_agent`),
then send indirect paraphrases — the stage-30 shape that fell back — with
procedural learning OFF vs ON and compare route rungs. Extraction stays off
to isolate the L3 effect.

**Result: the effect was not measurable, for two instructive reasons.**

| round | asks | fallback OFF | fallback ON |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | indirect, some capability words ("site notes", "workspace") | 0/3 | 0/3 |
| 2 | oblique, zero capability words ("line 3 walkthrough", "field visit") | 0/3 | 0/3 |

- **Round 1:** the router never failed. The `claude-sonnet-5` planner over the seeded
  registry descriptions routed every indirect paraphrase to the right sub
  agent without exemplar help. The stage-30 fallback finding did not
  reproduce under these conditions — the control arm has nothing for L3 to
  fix.
- **Round 2 (the interesting one):** the two obliquest asks produced
  `rungs=[]` in *both* arms — **no routing happened at all**. The planner
  answered directly from the injected episodic digests of the warm-up runs,
  citing memory ids and reproducing the specifics correctly (vibration
  2.1 mm/s, part SC-118, pending PLC firmware). The asks designed to confuse
  the router never reached the router: **L1 episodic memory absorbed the
  re-asks upstream of L3's target problem.** Fallback-prone indirect asks
  are typically *re*-asks about prior work — and prior work is exactly what
  digests cover.

**Conclusion:** the L3 exemplar mechanism is implemented and exercised
(both warm-ups harvested exemplars; recall, voting, and fallback→mined-skill
clustering are covered by the unit suite), but on this catalog its
end-to-end effect is masked — first by a router that doesn't fail on
paraphrases, then by episodic injection answering repeat asks before routing
begins. This *strengthens* the F4 recommendation: procedural learning is a
targeted layer for catalogs/models where routing demonstrably fails, not a
default-on layer. The layer to reach for first is episodic+semantic — it
removed the failure class this experiment went looking for.

## 5. Defects found *by* the experiment (fixed on this branch)

The experiment loop earned its keep beyond the matrix — three real defects
surfaced only under live measurement:

1. **`websearch_to_tsquery` AND-semantics vetoed recall** (`or_tsquery` fix,
   `f2a15a2`). Question boilerplate ("One short sentence") ANDed into the
   lexical query, so a stored fact matching only the content words scored
   zero — and the failed question's *own* digest outranked the truth on the
   next attempt. Lexical legs now build an OR-joined sanitized tsquery.
   Episodic went 3/7 → 6/7 on this fix alone.
2. **Memory purge 500ed on supersession chains** (`ed03297`). The
   self-referential `supersedes`/`superseded_by` FKs blocked the purge's
   two-pass delete the moment any fact had been corrected. Purge now nulls
   both link columns first; regression test covers a three-link chain.
3. **Silent purge failures contaminated configs** (`ed03297`). The harness
   POSTed to a route that didn't accept POST (405) and ignored response
   codes, so each config inherited the previous config's memories. A
   contaminated `full` run scored 4/7 — a leftover `main` fact from the
   prior phase survived reconciliation and beat the correction. Resets now
   raise on any non-2xx and verify the store is empty; the clean rerun
   scored 7/7. (Kept as a cautionary note: **cross-config contamination
   reads as "the new layer made things worse" when it's actually stale
   state.**)

## 6. Caveats

- **Fake embeddings floor.** All memory-on numbers used 64-dim bag-of-tokens
  vectors. Real embeddings should improve paraphrase recall (and could only
  have helped `episodic`'s one failure).
- **Preference probe is non-discriminative.** The baseline also passed it —
  bullet-formatted answers are common unprompted. It stays in the suite for
  regression value, not as evidence of memory benefit.
- **Small N.** 7 probes × 5 configs is an ablation smoke test, not a
  benchmark. Directional conclusions (F1–F5) rest on large effect sizes;
  fine-grained ranking between 7/7 configs rests on cost, not score.
- **One model pairing.** All runs on `claude-sonnet-5` (planner) over `claude-sonnet-4-6` (other roles). The §15 eval roadmap
  (spreadsheet-driven, LangSmith-published) is the vehicle for multi-model
  sweeps.

## 7. M18 — closed-loop refinement (implemented and measured)

The post-M17 enhancement review was implemented as spec §16.7 (commit `b2f0852`),
sharpening the winning layers rather than adding new ones:

- **Citation feedback (used beats retrieved).** Injection no longer bumps
  access bookkeeping; a post-run job matches injected memory-id prefixes
  against the final answer and reinforces only cited memories (+1 importance,
  capped; access bump). Uncited injections cool toward decay. Explicit
  `memory.recall` tool calls still count as use.
- **Digest compaction.** Run-digests older than 14 days (setting) fold into
  one period digest per conversation; raw rows and embeddings are deleted.
  The episodic store — the one unbounded table in the M17 design — becomes
  O(conversations).
- **Entity-hop recall.** Extraction names 0–3 entities per memory; writes
  maintain `memory_entities`/`memory_entity_links`; recall appends up to two
  floor-exempt linked memories at a discount of the weakest direct hit
  (skipped for kind-filtered and point-in-time recalls). One bounded join —
  no graph database.
- **Two "free" items verified rather than built**: OpenAI/Google embedding
  adapters already implement the provider port (production = set a key +
  `embedding_model`), and `memory.recall` already exposed `as_of` — both now
  covered by tests.

**Long-horizon time-warp simulation** (`experiments/memory/longhorizon.py`,
deterministic, no LLM): a 90-day backdated store — four memory cohorts, 8
conversations × 11 runs of digests, a seeded entity_key contradiction — run
through decay, contradiction, and compaction. All six equilibrium checks pass:

| check | result |
|---|---|
| E1 untouched low-importance memories expire | ✅ 10/10 expired |
| E2 rehearsed low-importance memories survive | ✅ 10/10 active |
| E3 pinned rows immune regardless of age | ✅ 3/3 active |
| E4 high-importance rows outlive same-age peers | ✅ 10/10 active |
| E5 episodic store compacts to O(conversations) | ✅ 88 digests → 7 period + 11 recent |
| E6 duplicate active entity_keys quarantined, oldest-validity wins | ✅ |

<!-- M18_REGRESSION -->

## 8. Recommended default configuration

Based on the matrix: **`semantic` shape** — memory on, extraction on,
procedural off (until the workload routes), injection budget 1200, floor
0.35, top-k 6, `fake:scripted` replaced by a real embedding model in
production. This is the configuration that dominated every axis measured.
